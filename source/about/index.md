Hi, I'm Jeremy Foster and I live in the great Pacific Northwest not too far from Seattle with my wife and two boys. We romp all over Washington and specifically love the Olympic Peninsula and the San Juan Islands.

I'm an Engineering Manager at Microsoft, and I'm here because I'm a big tech geek who loves writing code and creating solutions.

You'll notice there are no ads, no comments, and no offers of any kind on codefoster.com. That's because I don't have any motivation to host this site other than to document my thoughts, my career, and my life to some degree.

I use a static site generator called Hexo to make this site, so it costs me about $2/mo to host on Azure. Not bad.
