Hi, I'm Jeremy Foster and I live in the great Pacific Northwest not too far from Seattle.

I'm an Engineering Manager at Microsoft. I'm at Microsoft because I'm a big tech geek who loves writing code and creating solutions.

I'm resurrecting this blog right now. I haven't updated it in quite a few years, but recently decided to give it a facelift and generalize it a bit from simply representing my professional profile, to also representing my other ideas and endeavors in life.

You'll notice there are no ads, no comments, and no offers of any kind. That's because I don't have any motivation to host this site other than to document my thoughts, my career, and my life to some degree.

I use a static site generator called Hexo to make this site, so it costs me about $2/mo to host on Azure. Not bad.
