If you haven't seen the modified help system in Visual Studio 11 then prepare to be impressed. Now when you go to the Help menu, you can choose _Add and Remove Local Help Content_. Upon doing so, you'll be presented with a very helpful dialog box.
<!-- xmore -->

From here it is very easy to figure out how to choose which categories of help content you want to be installed locally and where it will be installed from.

I just installed all of the WinRT and JavaScript help content so now I can read it disconnected. Woohoo.
