Microsoft enjoys giving software away to students. It&#39;s obviously in everyone&#39;s best interest. Students get cutting edge technology and Microsoft gets young and hypercreative minds helping to shape the course of innovation for years to come.

If you are a student, signing up for DreamSpark is a no brainer. I can&#39;t think of a reason not to. The [DreamSpark website](http://www.dreamspark.com) is pretty simple, but my colleage Bret Stateham created [a slide show](http://1drv.ms/1oHc5cc) to make it just that much easier, or if you&#39;d rather watch a very extensive video demonstration of this process as well as the process of getting a Windows Store developer account, check out [Bret&#39;s YouTube video](http://aka.ms/stusuvid). And if you want to watch a [4 minute video of me actually signing up](http://1drv.ms/1lOFcEY).

Once you&#39;re in the program, download some development software, then check out [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://mva.ms) and get started writing curly braces. Writing code is a blast and may just help supplement your income while you work on that art history degree :)
