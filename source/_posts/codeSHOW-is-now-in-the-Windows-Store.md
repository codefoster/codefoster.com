The codeSHOW app is now certified and available in the Windows 8 Store. If you're wanting to learn development for Windows 8, use codeSHOW to browse a lot of demos and then see the code for them. There's a lot more to be added and some kinks to work out, but I hope it adds value to your life today. Updates should happen on a relatively frequent basis. Leave a review and tell me what you think.

If you have Windows 8, you can go directly to [http://aka.ms/codeshowapp](http://aka.ms/codeshowapp) to download it.
