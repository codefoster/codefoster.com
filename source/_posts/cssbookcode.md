Hello. I wrote a little book (my first actually) called CSS for Windows 8 App Development published by Apress. It's available at [aka.ms/cssbook](http://aka.ms/cssbook). All of the code listings from the book are available in a Windows 8 app that I have created, and you can download all of the source code for this app at [cssbookcode.codeplex.com](http://cssbookcode.codeplex.com). The code is not polished yet as the book is still in alpha, but it should build and run and you're welcome to take a look as early as you like. Thanks for reading my book. I wish you lots of fun and success in developing apps for Windows 8.
