I heard a long time ago that there are three types of people: apathetic, mediocre, and excellent. I would rather say there are two types: those who are _striving for excellence_ and those who _are not striving_.

Of the folks striving for excellence, there are again two types: those doing it for _themselves_ and those doing it for _others_.

Those striving for excellence for themselves are motivated by something like fame or power or acceptance, but those striving for excellence for the sake of others realize that their hard work, dedication, education, and persistence can make a real difference in helpingothersto grow.

Whatever your place in life, whatever your training or your role or your level, you most certainly have opportunity to apply effort for the sake of others.
