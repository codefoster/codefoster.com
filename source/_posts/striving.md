            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I heard a long time ago that there are three types of people: apathetic, mediocre, and excellent. I would rather say there are two types: those who are <em>striving for excellence</em> and those who <em>are not striving</em>.

Of the folks striving for excellence, there are again two types: those doing it for <em>themselves</em> and those doing it for <em>others</em>.

Those striving for excellence for themselves are motivated by something like fame or power or acceptance, but those striving for excellence for the sake of others realize that their hard work, dedication, education, and persistence can make a real difference in helpingothersto grow.

Whatever your place in life, whatever your training or your role or your level, you most certainly have opportunity to apply effort for the sake of others.]]></content:encoded>
