I've worked with Children of the Nations (COTNI) in the past and they are a very cool organization.

At one point, my wife and I and some friends volunteered for their Meal Marathon &ndash; an extremely grassroots effort to get food to hungry kids. The program wasn't a hundred layers of abstraction away from the actual goal &ndash; feeding hungry kids. Instead it was a simple matter of putting food in bags, putting bags in boxes, putting boxes in a shipping container, and shipping the container to Sierra Leone and the Dominican Republic. So simple...; so helpful.

Right now and until June 12, COTNI needs donations of the following items...;

*   School backpacks
*   School SmilePacks
*   Hygiene SmilePacks
*   Solar-powered flashlghts
*   Soccer cleats (any size)
*   Baseball cleats (any size)
*   Soccer balls
*   Soccer ball pumps
*   Baseballs
*   Baseball gloves

If you live anywhere near Silverdale, WA and would like to help get these items to the kids that need them, please go to [https://cotni.org/get-involved/locally/donate-resources](https://cotni.org/get-involved/locally/donate-resources) and get more information.
