A what?! It's an [iPazzPort](http://ipazzport.com/). I ordered one recently and I was sent two. Not a bad deal, but I really only need one, so I decided to give one away to one of my Twitter followers. It's new in the box. Read on for details. First, what is it...

I have a media center PC. Actually, it's just a PC that I hooked up to my 37" LCD TV and installed Windows 8 on. I like the start screen tiles on my tablet and my PC, but they're awesome for a media PC too! I put all of my media related programs on the start screen and now it's super easy to launch whatever I want.

## The device...

Well, I had a little remote control for the PC, but it decided to quit working a few weeks ago, and my wife asked if I could find a good solution. I think I did!

I found and ordered this iPazzPort. On one side it's a full Windows keyboard including the win key (which is important), arrow keys, and all of the symbols and function keys. Next to the keyboard are buttons to control a gyro mouse, so you can just swing the device around in the air to move your mouse. You can hit a key to switch mouse modes so that you can either hold it the long way or the short way (when you're using the keyboard). Then if you flip the device over, it has a few basic television remote buttons that you can train with your real TV remote. Finally, there are buttons on the side that act as page up and down which comes in extremely handy for web browsing and such. It has a rechargeable battery, so you just plug it into your computers USB port every few days to charge it up.

## The giveaway...

So I sent out a tweet. You can find it [here](https://twitter.com/codefoster/status/206064528843210752). If you retweet that and follow me on Twitter then you'll be entered to win. I'll keep it open until Thursday, May 31\. I'll draw a winner at random on that day and announce them on this blog post and on Twitter by noon Pacific time. If you're the lucky winner and you live in the United States, I'll mail you the iPazzPort.
