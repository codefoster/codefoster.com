I spend a lot of time using Git these days. It's one of those technologies you love and hate. I guess I use it because it feels just scrappy and simple and elegant enough to be the right tool for the job in most cases.


I've heard it said and completely agree that Git would be the ideal _offline_ source control solution if you didn't have to search _online_ for the syntax.

Well, maybe this will help. GitHub was at OSCON and they were handing out these handy little cheat sheets. I'm going to decorate my workstation wall with this. Perhaps you'll save it somewhere close or print and pin it yourself and get some use out of it. Hope so. Cheers.
