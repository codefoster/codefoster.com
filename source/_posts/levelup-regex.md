I’m sorry, but there’s no way around it. You have to master regular expressions. 
Just spend some time on regexr.com and look up the various ways to do regex’s in JavaScript. It’s strange because there are like 3-4 ways to execute regex’s in JavaScript… 
o	pattern.exec(string)
o	pattern.test(string)
o	string.match(pattern)
This page will help.
