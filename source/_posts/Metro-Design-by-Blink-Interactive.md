Last Friday my user group ("The Ocho") met and heard a special presentation on Metro Design thanks to Blink Interactive.

Valentina and Christina are UW students and interns at Blink and gave us a ton of information about user centric design and then the history and concepts behind Metro design.

I promised that I'd post their slide deck for those that want to take a look, so here it is.

If you were there with us, thanks for joining. If you weren't, then look up our next meeting at [http://www.meetup.com/theocho](http://www.meetup.com/theocho). Maybe we'll see you there.
