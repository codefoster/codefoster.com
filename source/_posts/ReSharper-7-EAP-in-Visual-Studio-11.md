I used to think that Visual Studio had an incredible set of keyboard shortcuts and productivity features. Then I installed ReSharper. Now a vanilla install of Visual Studio feels a bit vanilla.


Sure all of the refactorings are awesome, but what I end up missing when I’m missing R# is the little stuff. It’s the extend and shrink selection (Ctrl + Alt + Right Arrow/Left Arrow). It’s the next and previous member (Alt + Up/Down Arrow).

With R# 7 EAP, as with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, I installed it the same day it was available. I was thrilled at first too – ready to blaze through my Windows 8 projects at the speed of sharp. But I discovered shortly that my IntelliSense was not working. For JavaScript behind Metro apps, I got an IntelliSense menu, but the entries were all wrong. And an acquaintance had the same issue. This was a deal breaker and I sadly uninstalled R# from my machine.

Today I tried again and low and behold everything works! So my mood swing is back at its acme and I’m ready to blaze through the code again.
