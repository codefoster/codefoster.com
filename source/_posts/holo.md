If you&#39;re interested in learning how to write apps for Windows 8 but don&#39;t want to leave your desk to do it, then I have just the thing for you. They&#39;re called HOLOs. That&#39;s a Hands-On Lab Online. It goes like this.

First, you register and then when the event comes around, you log in and are hooked up with a Live Meeting to a presenter and a bunch of other attendees and also with a Hyper-V session to a Windows 8 virtual machine with all of the course work ready to go. You listen to the presenter for a while, and then you run through the labs with the instructor right there and ready to help when you raise your virtual hand.

There are sessions on a myriad of Windows 8 related subjects including...

*   Creating a Windows 8 App
*   Orientation, Snapping, and Semantic Zoom
*   Searching and Sharing
*   The Windows Store
*   Application Bars and Media Capture
*   Settings and Preferences

And each of those subjects has separate, dedicated online sessions for C# and JavaScript.

Go register now to save your spot. I created a short URL to a search of all of the HOLOs being offered &ndash; [http://aka.ms/holo](http://aka.ms/holo).

I&#39;m going to be presenting a number of the JavaScript courses, so I&#39;ll see you online!
