Based on two laps around the exhibitor hall at [OSCON](/oscon2014) and&nbsp;a couple of years working in the sometimes awkward space between marketing folks and developer folks, following is my list of the 10 most overused words in tech.

You&#39;ll find these on a zillion websites, banners, and those spring up signs that people drag around in the airport. There&#39;s probably a name for those, but I&#39;m glad not to know what it is. If you know, don&#39;t tell me.

It&#39;s all an attempt to make an API or a service that has no material substance come to shape and life in the mind of a developer so that he&#39;ll use it and love it and maybe make some contributions to the repo or pay some money for it.

And here they are...

1.  **ninja.** I have no idea how this expert in stealth, martial arts, and throwing stars came to represent the height of developer prowess, but it has... even though most developers wouldn&#39;t be caught dead in black uni-suits or toe socks, and likely would be caught dead if they tried sneaking into the enemy&#39;s lair under the cover of night.
2.  **awesome.** The term that attempts to capture that moment when a mortal lays eyes on a select sunset, a view of the milky way, or the power of God himself is reduced to describe the experience of successfully requesting a client record and retrieving his sales history.
3.  **guru.** One who knows everything about a religion becomes one who knows everything about his programming language.
4.  **leverage.** Sometimes the word _use_ would work just fine, but for some reason we&#39;re still compelled to _leverage _things.
5.  **cloud.** A list of clich&eacute;s would not be complete without cloud. Never has a term risen so high so quickly. Hey, that sort of works! Do keep in mind that your cloud is actually on the ground. I&#39;m just saying.
6.  **stack.** A choice of collaborating technologies building on top of one another. A stack. Got it. Yep, that describes it.
7.  **bits.** You&#39;ve never seen a bit, but you talk about them all the time. Is that in the _latest bits_? Do you have access to the _latest bits_.
8.  **mind blowing.** Sometimes it does feel like that, but not often. I can recall on fewer fingers than has one hand the number of technologies that have felt like they blew my mind. And even then my mind remained literally unblown.
9.  **real time.** Even though most of the time it&#39;s not true, it&#39;s fun to say that your software runs in real time. The more honest claim _near real time_ performance. What&#39;s near? Within the hour?
10.  **bacon.** And making the list due entirely to the fact that I saw it used an entire 3 times in one exhibit hall... bacon. I love bacon for breakfast. Heck, I love bacon for lunch and dinner and dessert too. It feels like a cheap shot though to compare your API to bacon so I&#39;ll love it. I&#39;m still going to use&nbsp;your API&nbsp;though... since you said bacon. I do love bacon.
