You need this is pretty much every solution you build. Learn… 
o	To call a function that returns a promise
o	To write a function that calls another function that returns a promise and returns that to the caller
o	To write a function that creates and returns a promise
o	To save a promise so you can check with it at any point and see if it’s been resolved. This is great for coordinating timing in a complex application.
o	Writing an async function using async instead of creating a promise
o	Calling an async function using await instead of .then()
o	The difference between these… 
	let x = myAsyncFunction;
	let x = myAsyncFunction();
	let x = await myAsyncFunction();
