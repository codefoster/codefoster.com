Woohoo! Welcome to the all new codefoster.com website.


I changed a lot about codefoster.com in this latest iteration, I've got most of my boxes unpacked, and I'm excited to be working out of the new space.

I switched CMS systems to one made out of Sweden, and we all know that the Swedish know how to make quality merch, right! The system is called [Lemoon by Mindroute Software](http://www.lemoon.com). It's very simple, very powerful, and built entirely and extensibly on ASP.NET.

To coincide with the launch of the new site, I have some new business cards...

Now just sit back and wait for content that will blow your mind. Well, we'll see about that.
