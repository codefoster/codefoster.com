If you haven't seen the modified help system in Visual Studio 11 then prepare to be impressed. Now when you go to the Help menu, you can choose _Add and Remove Local Help Content_. Upon doing so, you'll be presented with a very helpful dialog box.

From here it is very easy to figure out how to choose which categories of help content you want to be installed locally and where it will be installed from.

I just installed all of the WinRT and JavaScript help content so now I can read it disconnected. Woohoo.
