It's was a big day in Building 33 as 100 or so people gathered to write Windows 8 apps, compete for prizes, and hopefully learn a little something along the way. One of the things attendees learned was that Microsoft Learning (MSL) is really rockin' the Microsoft certifications lately. Paul Lee joined us at the hackathon to talk about the state of Microsoft certifications. They have tracks that based on software solutions and the technologies a developer would use to create them.

The one I'm excited about is the _MCSD: Windows Store Apps - HTML5_. Which you can earn if you take the [70-480](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-480), [70-481](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-481), and [70-482](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-482) exams. And actually, the first of those exams is free (for now) if you go to [http://www.register.prometric.com](http://www.register.prometric.com) to schedule your exam and use HTMLJMP as your promo code. If you want help studying for 70-480 and 70-481, you can take a look at the JumpStart videos that [Michael Palermo](http://www.palermo4.com) and I recorded at [http://aka.ms/jump480](http://aka.ms/jump480) and [http://aka.ms/jump481](http://aka.ms/jump481).

Attached are the slides that Paul presented.
