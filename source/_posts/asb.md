The topic of our conversation was encouragement to go beyond our inevitable role as _digital consumers_ and aspiring to be _digital producers_ first and foremost.

That means, we don&#39;t just entertain ourselves with what others have created, but we get behind the paint brush, the hand saw, or the mouse and we create it ourselves. We use it to inspire others, to lead others, and ultimately to love others. That&#39;s a charter.

First, we talked about making websites. You each got free Azure Passes, and I hope you&#39;ll redeem them for some cloud time. We made a website in just a few seconds in class, and you can do the same thing from home.

To redeem your pass, go to [microsoftazurepass.com](http://microsoftazurepass.com) and enter the code. Ignore the number on the left. The code starts with &#39;M&#39;.

Next, we looked at Touch Develop by visiting [touchdevelop.com](http://touchdevelop.com). You can go there any time from pretty much any device and make something awesome. When you&#39;re done, publish it and then send me a tweet at @codefoster, so I can help you tell the world about what you made!

We couldn&#39;t help ourselves and started talking about the exciting and coming Microsoft HoloLens project and the world of 3D. I showed you [Autodesk Fusion 360](fusion360.autodesk.com), which is my 3D modeling software of choice. If I had a HoloLens to design with, I would, but Fusion 360 is awesome too :) Since you&#39;re students, you can download and use Fusion 360 without charge.

Finally, we learned how you can take your JavaScript skills to the world of devices and the Internet of Things. We set up Tweet Monkey, sent a tweet with #tweetmonkey, and watched him dance away.

Tweet Monkey is a really simple project that will help you get the basics of using JavaScript to control _things_. It&#39;s controlled by the awesome Intel Edison. I have blogged extensively about this device at [codefoster.com/edison](codefoster.com/edison). You can get all the details at [codefoster.com/tweetmonkey](codefoster.com/tweetmonkey). If you want to graduate from Tweet Monkey and try something harder, check out his older brother Command Monkey at [codefoster.com/commandmonkey](codefoster.com/commandmonkey).

Thank you again for your motivation. That&#39;s inspiring to me. Be sure to keep in touch and tell me about the cool things you make.
