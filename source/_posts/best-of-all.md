I'm doing a lot of ramping up on Windows 8 these days, and it's really exciting. I have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XAML, C#, and even C++. And with Windows 8, I'll have the chance to take my pick. Metro-style apps as they're called on Windows 8 are usually going to be either A) HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, B) XAML/C#, or C) XAML/C++.

## HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript

This route would be a good choice if you already have web development skills and perhaps have an app already developed in these web technologies. I imagine the process will be to grab all of the markup and script from your existing app, paste it into your new Windows 8 app, likely convert the styles to be more "metro", and then convert the aspects of your app that can use the underlying OS and device features. That's not nearly as bad as a complete rearchitecture. Even though the languages are compatible, however, the style of a Windows 8 app is rather unique and I don't know that the application sharing will be quite as cross-platform as some may think.

## XAML/C#

This is exciting route in my opinion. I have a ton of web design and development experience, but even HTML5/CSS3 can't compete with the rich offerings of XAML. And I've authored a lot of JavaScript and jQuery, but I would still way rather be in C# writing LINQs and lambdas and interfaces and such.

## XAML/C++

And finally, the uber performant, low-level route going with XAML and C++. I don't personally enjoy writing C++. It's been too long since college, and for how seldom I need the miniscule performance boost, it's not worth the productivity hit. I don't like writing assembly code or machine code either by the way.

So I'm pretty pumped about Windows 8 development. Now get your copy of the developer preview (or the beta before too long!) and start making apps.
