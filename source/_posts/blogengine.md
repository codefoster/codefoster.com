>EDIT (2014-07): Since writing this, I&#39;ve since ditched this system and upgraded again. See [this post](/better) to find where [codefoster.com](http://codefoster.com) is at from a technical standpoint.

>EDIT (2016-12): Well, I&#39;ve done it again. Now I&#39;m using [Hexo.io](http://hexo.io) - the Node.js static site generator.

I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve moved off of WordPress. I&#39;m not sure what it is I didn&#39;t like about WordPress, but I just didn&#39;t. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re too big... shoot, I work at Microsoft. It&#39;s not that their blogging solution doesn&#39;t work because it definitely does. I guess I just felt like I was in a machine. I like to feel free.

I don&#39;t like to feel like any second I&#39;m going to get hit with another $12/yr charge because I want to add such-and-such feature.

I&#39;m using BlogEngine.NET now and it has thrilled me so far. It plugged in easily to my own self-hosted site and seems to have the perfect set of features. Now I feel like I can customize all I want. I feel free.
