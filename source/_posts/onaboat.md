As you read this, I&#39;m in the Pacific ocean, actually hopefully I&#39;m _on_ the Pacific ocean in a sail boat.
<!-- xmore -->

If you know me, you know that I&#39;m a little into sailing. It would be more accurate to say that I&#39;m into _cruising_. Sailing is something you do to make a boat go forward without costing you any money. Cruising is something you do to spend time with friends and family in the sun, in the water, in the wild.

I get precious little time to do either right now since I&#39;m raising a young family, but my wife and I are entertaining eventual dreams of some serious voyaging and decided to get some big ocean experience sooner than later to append to my extensive coastal cruising days.

I&#39;ll be at sea for about 1200 miles without any site of land, and you can bet I brought some serious digital resources to take advantage of the long helm shifts.

So if you send me an email, you&#39;ll get an OOF message. I won&#39;t be checking it out here. There will be no flashing lights (except for my GoPro) or ringing chimes for missed text messages.

If my sanity returns with me I&#39;ll post photos here.

Fair winds.
