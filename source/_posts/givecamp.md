In less than two months, a number of charities will gather in the Commons on the Microsoft campus with a lot of project requirements to share. Those projects will be matched up with developers from the area that are willing to give a weekend to help out a good cause. Many hours will be spent furiously designing and coding away, and at the end of the weekend the fruits will be shared.

I haven't been to a Give Camp before, but I've heard that it's pretty remarkable what can get accomplished in a weekend and how helpful it is to the charities. Many of these groups are on very tight budgets and don't normally have IT help or don't have nearly enough.

If you're going to be around the weekend of October 19-21, I encourage you to go to [http://seattlegivecamp.org](http://seattlegivecamp.org) and sign up as a volunteer designer or developer. Even if you don't have technical skills, you can volunteer to cover other needs. You can put your skills to a really good use and probably end up having a good time to boot.

I hope I'll see you there.
