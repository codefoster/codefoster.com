In case you haven&#39;t heard, Microsoft has an incentive [link removed] going on right now where any app you create, you can get $100 for. That&#39;s not bad considering how easy it is to make an app. Well, not all apps are easy. Some apps take quite a substantial bit of time, but if you&#39;re just trying to get a good app into the Windows Store quickly (like say for $100!) there are some tricks you should know. There&#39;s a template at [w8templates.codeplex.com](http://w8templates.codeplex.com), for instance, that you can customize with a few search terms and RSS feeds and in a matter of minutes, you&#39;ve got a data and media rich app all about the topic of your choice.


I just made an app using this template. It&#39;s called The Sailing App. One of the tasks you&#39;ll have to complete if you go down this road is to create your own graphics for the app tiles, splash screen, etc. Well, I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m a big fan of CorelDRAW, so I made a template and I&#39;m posting it here for you. By the way, if you&#39;d like your very own free copy of CorelDRAW X6 Essentials, just join a ZERO260 event [link removed]. We&#39;re giving them away.

Here&#39;s that template. Have fun!
