Hey, Metro developers, if you&#39;re using HTML/JS to build your apps, I have a little golden nugget for you. Actually, it&#39;s possible you already know and I&#39;m the one that&#39;s late to the game. Anyway, have you ever made a little tiny tweak to your HTML structure, a slight mod to your CSS style, or a little enhancement to your JavaScript and wanted to see the change effect immediately instead of relaunching your app each time? It&#39;s a valid desire. My last job was website development and so I&#39;m used to the whole save, switch, refresh workflow.

If you&#39;re working without the debugger attached, then you know it&#39;s not that difficult, you just hit CTRL + F5 again.

If you are working with the debugger attached, however, you might think you have to stop (SHIFT + F5) and then start again (F5). Actually, though, all you have to do is hit F4 (Fast Refresh is how we call that)! Now that&#39;s handy!
