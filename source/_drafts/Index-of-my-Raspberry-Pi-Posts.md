I've been doing a lot of hacking on the Raspberry Pi, and I've written a few articles on the topic. I've assembled all of my posts here for easy access.

*   [_Accidental Old Version of Node on the Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-oldnode/) - I beat my head against a wall for a long time wondering why I wasn't able to do basic GPIO on a Raspberry Pi using Node. Even after a fresh image and install, I was getting cryptic node error messages when I ran my basic blinky app.Lucky for me (and perhaps you) I got to the bottom of it and am going to document it here for posterity.
*   [_The Most Basic Way to Access GPIO on a Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-basicgpio) - I'm always looking for the lowest level understanding, because I hate not knowing how things work. On a Raspberry Pi, I'm able to write a Node app that changes GPIO, but how does that work? Turns out it's pretty interesting. I'll show you.
*   [_Easy and Offline Connection to your Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-easyoffline) - Getting a Raspberry Pi online is really easy if you have an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but what about if you want to get connected to your Pi while you're, say, flying on a plane?
*   [_Wifi on the Command Line on a Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-wifi/) - How to configure wireless connections on your Raspberry Pi from the command line.
