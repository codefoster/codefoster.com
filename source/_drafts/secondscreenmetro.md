You know those sonic noise guns that you can shoot at people and they supposedly just stop in their tracks because it's physically disorienting? I felt like I got hit with one when I ran across this little nugget.

Want to move your Metro experience from your primary monitor to another screen - say your second (or fourth) monitor or even to the projector for a show? I've been told that the start menu appears on the primary monitor (without resorting to the simulator). Period. But that's not the case! *look up* *thank God*

If you press **WIN + PGUP/PGDN**, you can change which monitor the start menu and all Metro apps appears on. Now that's awesome! Until now, I was resorting to the simulator for getting my icons on my second monitor or projector to show people. News must spread. Tell everyone.
