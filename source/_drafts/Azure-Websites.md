It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally all transferred over to Azure Websites for codefoster.com. It feels good. It feels like the future. The management portal is excellent and I have all of my cloud stuff in one place now (and it's not in [HP's cloud thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc_J3_SQp6M)).
