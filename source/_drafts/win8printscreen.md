Here's a nifty trick. When you hold the Windows key and hit Print Screen, you get a screen shot, but it's not just copied to your clipboard as in earlier versions of Windows. Now it is also saved as Screenshot.png in your Pictures folder.

If you do another one, the former is overwritten on the clipboard, but in the Pictures folder you get serial numbered files: Screenshot.png, Screenshot (2).png, Screenshot (3).png. That's as far as I went, but I'd bet good money that if I did it again I'd get Screenshot (4).png.
