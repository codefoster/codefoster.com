It's the long weekend!

Time to breath a sigh of relief and take some time off. If you're a tech head and love your job like me then it might be a bit of a discipline to shut down all the systems, unplug, and relax. But it's worth it.

Surely you've had this experience a hundred times... you are fighting a bug or a seemingly insurmountable technical issue and you feel like you must... just... keep... working. Then you finally give up and step away for some length of time. Upon returning to the issue then, you have it fixed in 10 minutes. That happens to me all the time. So much in fact that I've learned to just walk away and try again later. I think it's a good use of time.

Consider how productive you'll be upon returning from this long weekend then.

I guess if I'm blogging then I'm not unplugged, so here goes. Over and out.
