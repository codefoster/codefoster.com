I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from [Stephen Walther](http://stephenwalther.com/), so I&rsquo;m excited that his book on Windows 8 Apps with HTML and JavaScript Unleashed is available for [pre-order](http://www.informit.com/buy.aspx?isbn=0672336057). Save 40% through the end of November. If you see a lot of Windows 8 and a lot of JavaScript down the road like I do, you&rsquo;ll want to learn everything Stephen knows about it.
