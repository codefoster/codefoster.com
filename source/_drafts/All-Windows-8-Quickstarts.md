If you&#39;re looking for training material for Windows 8, you&#39;ll find quite a lot online. It can be overwhelming finding stuff online though. I consider it part of my job to help you locate things, so here&#39;s a tip. Just do a search in the Windows 8 Dev Center ([http://dev.windows.com](http://dev.windows.com)) for the word &#39;quickstart&#39;; and you&#39;ll find a lot of walk-through articles that are really helpful in figuring out how things work. Here&#39;s a link to that search directly: [http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US/windows/apps?query=quickstart&amp;Refinement=180](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US/windows/apps?query=quickstart&amp;Refinement=180)
