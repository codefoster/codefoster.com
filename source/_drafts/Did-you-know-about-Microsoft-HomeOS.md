Because I didn&#39;t. Not until recently.

[HomeOS](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/homeos/) has apparently been out for a little while and recently received a hefty update to coincide with the [Lab of Things ](http://www.lab-of-things.com/)project.

I wish I had time to install and try both of these projects and report my findings to you, but I&#39;ll have to leave the sleuth work to you. I&#39;m just reminded by this project about how many amazing things come out of the MSR group that push the boundaries of computer science and turn the crank of true geeks everywhere.
