Actually, it's possible you already know and I'm the one that's late to the game. Anyway, have you ever made a little tiny tweak to your HTML structure, a slight mod to your CSS style, or a little enhancement to your JavaScript and wanted to see the change effect immediately instead of relaunching your app each time? It's a valid desire. My last job was website development and so I'm used to the whole save, switch, refresh workflow.

If you're working without the debugger attached, then you know it's not that difficult, you just hit CTRL + F5 again.

If you are working with the debugger attached, however, you might think you have to stop (SHIFT + F5) and then start again (F5). Actually, though, all you have to do is hit F4 (Fast Refresh is how we call that)! Now that's handy!
