I&#39;m in a Microsoft building today that I&#39;ve not been in before. There are a lot of them since I&#39;m a relatively new employee. This one houses a lot of the work that goes into the Windows Phone 7 operating system, and that&#39;s pretty cool.

I arrived early for my conference and decided to spend some time meandering. A 3rd floor native told me I should visit the Windows Phone design studio on the 2nd. The design studio looks like a bunch of art supplies, flowers, and rainbows blew up. It&#39;s very cool actually.

I&#39;m a propeller head for sure, so it&#39;s important to me that a system _functions _correctly, but I want never to forget that art matters. It matters because it&#39;s human like your users. When I picked out my SCUBA gear, for instance, its ability to sustain my existence while I&#39;m under water was certainly high on my priority list, but it was also an assumption for the most part. SCUBA gear wouldn&#39;t likely make it to the consumer shelf if it wasn&#39;t well tested. So I essentially set that aside and look for gear that I enjoy looking at - gear that makes me feel like a&nbsp;Navy Seal Ninja.

Know that your users are making the same assumptions that your application is going to _function_ as it&#39;s intended, and they are going to choose it, keep it, and pay for it based on its art. Is it beautiful? Is it smooth like butter? Is it inspirational.
